A materials chemist by training, I work to enhance the properties of nanomaterials.

I'm currently a PhD candidate in solid state chemistry, working with [Dr Mathew Maye](http://nano.syr.edu) at [Syracuse University](https://syracuse.edu/).
My graduate research deals with transition metal nanoparticles. Mainly, the morphological evolution in core/shell type nanomaterials due to oxidative Kirkendall phenomenon (e.g. formation of internal voids). Further research focuses on utilizing our findings to create highly corrosion resistant nanoscale "*stainless Steel*".

I obtained my Bachelors of Technology degree from the [Institute of Chemical Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Chemical_Technology) in Mumbai.
