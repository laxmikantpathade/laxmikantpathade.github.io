A materials chemist by training, I teach chemistry and work towards fostering interest in sciences. I currently teach variety of chemistry classes at a private school in Florida.

I earned my PhD in chemistry, working with [Dr. Mathew Maye](http://nano.syr.edu) at [Syracuse University](https://syracuse.edu/). My [graduate research](https://surface.syr.edu/etd/931/) dealt with oxidation in transition metal nanoparticles, where I studied the oxidation rates and subsequent morphological evolution in nanomaterials to create highly corrosion resistant "*nanoscale stainless Steel*". I also taught Honors Chemistry labs with emphasis on research grade topics. I obtained my Bachelors of Technology degree from the [Institute of Chemical Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Chemical_Technology) in Mumbai.

 Please note that the CV and resume on this website are outdated and please contact me via email (listed on CV) if you need to get in touch. Thanks.
