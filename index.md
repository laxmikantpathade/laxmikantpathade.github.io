A materials chemist by training, I teach chemistry and work towards enhancing the properties of nanomaterials.

I'm currently a PhD candidate in solid state chemistry, working with [Dr Mathew Maye](http://nano.syr.edu) at [Syracuse University](https://syracuse.edu/). My graduate research deals with oxidation in transition metal nanoparticles, where I studied the oxidation rates and subsequent morphological evolution in nanomaterials to create highly corrosion resistant "*nanoscale stainless Steel*". I also teach Honors Chemistry labs with emphasis on research grade topics.

I obtained my Bachelors of Technology degree from the [Institute of Chemical Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Chemical_Technology) in Mumbai.
