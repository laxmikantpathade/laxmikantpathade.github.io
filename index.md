A materials chemist by training, I teach chemistry and work towards fostering interest in sciences. I currently teach variety of chemistry classes at a private school in Florida.

I earned my PhD in chemistry, working with [Dr Mathew Maye](http://nano.syr.edu) at [Syracuse University](https://syracuse.edu/). My graduate research dealt with oxidation in transition metal nanoparticles, where I studied the morphological evolution in nanomaterials to create corrosion resistant “nanoscale stainless Steel”. I also taught Honors Chemistry labs with emphasis on research grade topics. I obtained my Bachelors of Technology degree from the [Institute of Chemical Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Chemical_Technology) in Mumbai.
